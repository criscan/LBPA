Length-Based Pseudo-cohort Analysis (LBPA)
(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105810)

Stock status for many medium- and small-scale fisheries is unknown due, for example, to a lack of catch data and
the absence of scientific observer programs. However, length-frequency data are often available for such fisheries
because they are the cheapest and easiest data to obtain. Various stock assessment methods have been developed
that use length-frequency data and make equilibrium assumptions regarding both recruitment and fishing
mortality. These assumptions raise questions regarding the reliability of the results, particularly when the
method is applied to a single sample of length-frequency. We developed a Length-Based Pseudo-cohort Analysis
(LBPA) model whose parameters can be estimated using multiple length frequencies and penalized maximum
likelihood, under the assumption that using more than one length-frequency sample reduces the effects of the
equilibrium conditions assumed in the model. We explored the performance of LBPA using simulations that
examined the implications for estimation of the spawning potential rate (SPR) and the relative fishing mortality
(F/FMSY). These simulations considered scenarios related to exploitation rate, steepness, numbers of years and
sample sizes for length-frequency, and data weights. The performance of LBPA was compared to that of lengthbased
spawning potential ratio (LBSPR). LBPA performed better with additional length-frequencies than with
increased sample size, irrespective of how the data were weighted, and generally outperformed LBSPR. Estimates
were more accurate and less biased when exploitation rates were high. This work provides guidelines that should
be considered when using length-based pseudo-cohort models for data-poor fisheries.

For run the model, be keep to have into same directory/folder these files

- LBPA.exe
- LBPA.dat
- LBPA.tpl

*.tpl file must be compiled in ADMB for producing the executable file (.exe). Also, you will find the executable file for windows (.mexe). Be keep to rename the extension file .mexe by .exe. Depending on your operating system, you can compile the source code (.tpl) as be necessary
